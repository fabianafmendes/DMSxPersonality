#### Survey timeline
This survey was executed from March 2018 to June 2020, as shown in the timeline bellow.

Time | Survey phase
--------------- | ----
Mar − Jun 2018	| Survey planning
Jun − Jul 2018	| Instrument design
Jun 2018	      | Survey pilot
Jun 2018	      | Participant recruitment
Jul − Sep 2018	| Data collection

The survey instrument is composed of questionnaires that have been used many times before however, because all the survey participants are Brazilian, the questions were translated into Portuguese. Furthermore, since the instrument is long, the questionnaire distribution strategy was tested using the survey pilot. These activities were executed during the **instrument design phase**.

During the **recruitment phase**, a message with the research goal and other details related to the survey was sent to 344 people. The message also asked the individual to suggest other people who could participate in the survey. We sent an email with the questionnaire link only to those who agreed to participate.

The **data-collection phase** started when we sent the questionnaire link to the participants. We also sent three follow-up reminders to increase the dataset size.
In order to provide feedback to the survey participants, we created a report for every person who requested it and who filled all four parts of the survey. The report briefly explained the theory behind the questions and the participant's score for the five personality facets, decision-making style, and decision-making self-efficacy domain.

We received feedback for 15 of the 61 participants we sent a report to, discussing their experience in answering the survey. Some stated that they had never thought about how they make decisions before the survey. Others said that the survey helped them to think about factors that can influence their decisions. Some confirmed that the report describes their decision-making and personality characteristics accurately.

#### Time Method 
Cross-section

#### Sampling Procedure
All the participants were main author's acquaintances; therefore, we used a **non-probabilistic convenience sample**. They were contacted via email or other online-messaging tools (such as Facebook and LinkedIn messengers). Participation in the survey was on a voluntary basis, and only those respondents who agreed to participate received a link to the data-collection instrument (an online questionnaire).

We also executed **snowballing** in two different ways. We sent a message to the main author's acquaintances who did not comply with the criteria to select the survey population and we asked them to contact others who might also be willing to participate in the study. We also asked the main author's acquaintances who complied with the criteria and agreed to participate in the survey to contact others to participate in the survey. Therefore, we performed a **non-probabilistic snowballing**.

In total, 344 people were contacted, out of which 138 agreed to participate (40.12%). The survey was divided into four parts. Among those who agreed to participate, 102 answered only the first part (73.91%), and 63 participants answered all four parts of the survey (46.38%). The following table summarizes the sampling statistics.

Description	| Number	| Percentage
------------|---------| ---------
Received invitation	| 344	| -
Accepted invitation	| 138	| 40.12% success rate
Number of answers per questionnaire part||
Part I	| 102	| 73.91% of the 138 who accepted the invitation
Part II	| 74	| 53.62 % of the 138 who accepted the invitation
Part III|	63	| 46.38 % of the 138 who accepted the invitation
Part IV	| 63	| 46.38 % of the 138 who accepted the invitation


#### Collection Mode

#### Data File Language

#### Number of Variables and Datapoints
* 47 variables
* 120 datapoints for all variables except "Decision-Making Style" that has 63 datapoints

#### Strategies to Deal with Potential Survey Errors

In terms of **coverage bias**, the main problem of this survey population is the geographical distribution. The whole survey population is Brazilian, although some of the participants work in other countries. Another coverage problem is that most of the survey population hold technical roles. These characteristics can impact the generalization power of the survey results.

In order to deal with **selection bias**, during the planning phase, we defined the roles and criteria for selecting the survey population. Using this strategy, we reduced the selection bias. Finally, for nonresponse bias, we first sent a message asking for a commitment to survey participation. We sent the survey instrument only to those who agreed to participate. Furthermore, we also sent four reminders to increase the response rate.

This survey used an automatic tool to collect data; it exports a file with all the responses. This file was made available to the co-authors upon request; in this manner, they could verify any possibility of **data fabrication**.

The variable related to education level was changed after data collection; this does not characterize cheating but a correction in the data. In Brazil, there are post-bachelor courses, usually one year in duration, with classes during the weekends. Through these courses, students acquire a more profound knowledge of specific subjects, such as agile methodologies and web development. Ten participants marked the “other” option and described the subject in which they have specialized. We decided to merge these 10 responses into the “bachelor’s degree” category, because these are not degree programs.

The **response error** is related to the accuracy of the response given. It relates to respondent comprehension and knowledge of the questions and their alternatives, as well as their sincerity in answering the questionnaire. During the pilot study, one of the goals was to assess the questionnaire's clarity and understandability. Furthermore, the researcher guaranteed the anonymity of the responses; in this way, we protected the survey participants from any repercussions that might result from an honest answer.
