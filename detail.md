## Completeness of Data Restrictions
The variables of the baseline are named in the data as k-starting and the follow-up survey as f-starting. The questionnaire contains information on the indicators used in the data (quF3436.pdf). The questions asking for experiences during the previous 12 months are generally in the follow-up form in the form "during the previous 6 months".
  The following measures have been taken on the material for identification reasons. Open variables concerning the place of group activity, the housing situation and the main activity have been removed from the data. The numbers, years of birth, ages, heights and weights (bv5, k7_1 f7_1, k3, f3, k42, f42, k43, f43) of the household are still TOP or BOTTOM coded. Municipal information in the background variable bv2 has been removed from the immigrant group. For young people and the long-term unemployed, the marital status widow has been changed to missing information (k3, f3). In the municipal variable bv5, Imatra and Outokumpu are classified together. The open answers submitted have been checked for identifying information.
  In the continuous variables (k34, k35, k36, k43) the answers given as ranges (e.g. 1-2) have been replaced by the mean of the range and about the expressions (e.g. approx. 5) have been changed to the given number.
  Only the questions repeated in the questionnaires of different groups are the same in the material. The numbering or order of the variables may not correspond to the original questionnaire. The input variable f10 and the resource variables f17_1 and f17_2 have been removed from the data as ambiguous variables. In addition, length data for older people have been removed from the variable k43 due to incorrect values.
