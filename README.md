## Abstract:
Software development involves many activities, among which decision-making is an essential one. Various factors can impact a decision-making process, and it is essential to
understand them to improve the process. Since people make decisions, some human aspects are amongst such impacting factors. One such aspect is the decision makerâ€™s personality. This research aimed to investigate the relationship between decision-making and personality within the context of software project development. We conducted a survey research that gathered data about the personalities, decision-making style, and decision-making self-efficacies of 102 Brazilian software engineers. However, for decision making style variable the number of datapoints is 63. 

#### Kewords: decision-making, personality, software engineering.
